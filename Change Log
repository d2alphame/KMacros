============
Corrected my mistakes in the macros 'ifnbelow' and 'ifnabove'. Corrected the jumps to 'jb ...' and 'ja ...' respectively.

============
Edited the 'return' macro so that it can also be invoked as 'return success' or as 'return failure'. These forms of return
do not return any values. They just set (failure) and clear (success) the carry flag and return.

Added macro definitions "%define success 'success' " and "%define failure 'failure' ". To be used with the return macro.

Changed the "checkContext" macro to "exit". Intended to be used to close sub-routines much like "End Sub" and "End Function"
in VB. It doesn't assemble into any code. It only checks the context stack to ensure that all loops and blocks are properly
closed

============
Edited the 'return' macro so that it can return from a routine without returning a value or affecting the carry flag.
Those could be done manually if at all needed
